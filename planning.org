** twitter
*** DONE post tweet from commandline
*** DONE post image from commandline
    need to test out some python libraries, probably
    maybe also some ruby gems, idk
*** DONE post tweet from python script
    tweepy looks good
    twython also looks good
*** DONE post image from python script
    media_upload seems to be the keyword here
*** tweet text
    specifically, generate a message to be included with the tweet

** toaster

*** TODO shoot toast way up
*** TODO make toaster play after dark midi anthem

** camera
*** DONE capture images
    picamera should be good, might also use webcam
*** DONE capture the right images
    pics are no good without toast in them
*** TODO overlay timestamp on images
*** TODO stretch goal: photo filters
    how cool would this be: a random photo filter for each toast

** integration (after the rest of the pieces are done)
*** DONE tweet a picture taken with camera
*** DONE capture an image on a sensor trigger
*** DONE tweet a picture taken when sensor goes off
*** DONE put it all together

** documentation
*** TODO write a blog post about it or something

** more toaster planning
*** DONE make toaster fly
    need to research this
    wings, maybe? after dark style?
*** TODO make toaster self-aware
